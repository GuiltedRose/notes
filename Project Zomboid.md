# New Start
This is going to be the first of a series of posts created over the course of a few days. I will make updates on my phone each time night falls; until a watch is found. These stories will be described in first person through the eyes of the character(s). This is because I really like this game, and it's very easy to die, so a run can range from a few minutes to several days.
