# The Beginning:
There I was, tied up and surrounded by a bunch of hooded figures… they took me straight to the ones who burdened me… they call them the three bishops. These things; they aren’t like the rest of us.. they crave power. Crave the death of all lambs, unsure why but they spoke of a prophecy.
I was slain before I had a chance to tell them they were wrong…

## The One Who Waits:
I met a new being similar to the rest… I’m not sure how I got here, but I’m **dead?!?!**!!
