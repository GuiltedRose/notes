## About The Language:
	This project is going by the name Hydra-Core. It aims to be a systems language like C, C++, Rust, Zig, etc. it will also be as simple to learn as something like python (maybe?).
## What Language is it Based in?
	To start I am implementing the basics in Rust, then after we have a decent enough code base going it can be recompiled to replace most of the tooling with itself. If rust stays at all it's only to give it a better cross platform tool.
## Language Goals:
* Simple to learn/read (Like python or ruby)
* Structured kinda like Zig & C (No memory safety)
* Robust Standard Library
* No dependencies
* No Garbage Collection (This may be similar to BC, if needed).
* Direct Access to Assembly
* STD Error handling & Compiled (Forge)
* Should be able to use something like make
